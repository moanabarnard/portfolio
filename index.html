         <div class="about">
            My name is Moana Barnard, I am a first year student at Massey university studying a bachelor of design.
            I have had a keen interest in design for as long as I can remember, as a child I spent my days designing
            various floorpans, dresses and inventions as well as drawing and collaging. This website is a portfolio
            of my work, past and present.
